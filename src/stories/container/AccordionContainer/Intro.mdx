# Accordion Container

`AccordionContainer` displays a list of expandable/collapsible components built on MUI's `Accordion` component. Its header and content is fully customizable.

### Use Cases

Here we are using `AccordionContainer` to display filter sections but it can be used for FAQs, Marketing Material and any other place which needs a display for collapsible content.

### Inputs

```
AccordionContainer.propTypes = {
  accordionData: PropTypes.arrayOf(
    PropTypes.shape({
      id: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      icon: PropTypes.node, // Optional icon to display before the summary
      headerComponent: PropTypes.node.isRequired, // Any React node for the primary header
      secondaryHeaderComponent: PropTypes.node, // Any React node for the secondary header, optional
      detailsComponent: PropTypes.node.isRequired, // Any React node for the details
    })
  ).isRequired,
};
```


### State

The component manages its expanded state, tracking which accordion panel is currently open. This allows for only one panel to be expanded at a time.

### Keyboard Navigation

- Users can navigate between accordion headers using the Tab key.
- The Enter or Spacebar keys toggle the expansion of the focused accordion panel.

### ARIA Attributes

Built into the Accordion component:
- `aria-controls`: Connects the accordion summary to the corresponding details panel
- `aria-expanded`: Indicates whether the accordion panel is expanded or collapsed

Additions:
- `aria-hidden="true"` on icons
- role="region" and aria-labelledby for AccordionDetails (to associate it with its heading)
