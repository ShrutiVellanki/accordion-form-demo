# Checkbox Form Group

The `CheckboxFormGroup` component is designed to encapsulate a group of checkboxes, allowing users to select multiple options from a set. This component enhances form functionality by grouping related options together, making it easier for users to understand their choices and for developers to manage form state.

### Use Cases

`CheckboxFormGroup` is ideal for forms where users can make multiple selections, such as filters in a search interface, settings with multiple options, and anywhere you need to present a list of options with checkboxes. It's especially useful for enhancing user experience by grouping related checkboxes under a common label or question.

### Inputs

```
// Shape of a checkbox option
interface Option {
  value: string;
  label: string;
}

// inputs to CheckboxFormGroup
interface CheckboxFormGroupProps {
  options: Option[];
  name: string;
  label: string;
  checkedValues: string[];
  onCheckboxChanged: (chipKey: string) => void;
  onSelectAllChanged: (isAllSelected: boolean) => void;
  description?: string;
  disabledValues?: string[];
  indeterminate?: boolean;
}
```

### State

Managing state in `CheckboxFormGroup` involves tracking which checkboxes are checked and potentially handling a select-all functionality. By lifting state up, the parent component can control the checkboxes' state, allowing for more complex behaviors like conditional enabling/disabling of options based on other form inputs.

### Keyboard Navigation

`CheckboxFormGroup` supports standard keyboard navigation for accessibility:
- Tab navigation to move focus between checkboxes.
- Spacebar to toggle the selected state of a focused checkbox.

### ARIA Attributes

To ensure `CheckboxFormGroup` is accessible, it uses various ARIA attributes:
- `role="group"` for the container to indicate that the checkboxes form a group.
- `aria-checked` on each checkbox to indicate its checked state to assistive technologies.
- `aria-disabled` to indicate if a checkbox is disabled.
- Optionally, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` can be used to provide an accessible name for the checkbox group.
- `aria-describedby` may be used to associate additional descriptive text with the group, enhancing the user's understanding of the available options.
